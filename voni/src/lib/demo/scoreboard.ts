/**

 * goodbyeCut, TAG=Lime 42) and the e2e specs they mirror; nothing here
 * retunes pipeline thresholds or gains — the windows quote them.
 *
 * The harness measures nothing yet: per-beat gap/cut/drain milliseconds are
 * placeholders, probe counts start at zero, and every gate reports PASS/INFO
 * (no FAIL until gating lands in later tickets). What this module guarantees
